## Process

The process included creating four sections: 'About, Skills, Projects, Contact'. The nav bar includes links to each section. In the about section, my name, a short bio, and my picture is included. The skills display pictures of each program I am familiar with. The projects section showcases each project and allows for a clickable link to see each project. The contact section shows my email, phone number, and address. The styling was done with Bootstrap and CSS. I wanted a polished and sophisticated look but with a bit of color as well. The use of box-shadows added more color as well. The font is imported from Google Fonts, and variables were used to reuse color throughout the application.
